# lung-nodule-detection-yolov8
This project leverages YOLOv8 and AWS SageMaker to detect lung nodules in CT scan images â€” an essential step toward early lung cancer diagnosis. The system automates CT image preprocessing, model training, and deployment on SageMaker endpoints using scalable cloud infrastructure.
